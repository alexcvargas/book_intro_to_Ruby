# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# Exception handling is a way to write code to withstand getting caught up
#   in failure or things that the program could get hung up on.
# There are many exceptions to choose from and you can find them in the documentation:
https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Exception.html



# Book answer: Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility
#   of an error occurring in a program.
# It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control
#   without exiting the program entirely.

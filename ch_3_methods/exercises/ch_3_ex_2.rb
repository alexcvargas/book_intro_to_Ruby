# 2. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
# That is, what does each expression return?

# 2.1
x = 2
# nothing on screen
# returns => 2

# 2.2
puts x = 2
# => 2
# returns => nil

# 2.3
p name = "Joe"
# => "Joe"
# returns => "Joe"

# 2.4
four = "four"
# nothing on screen
# returns => "four"
# simple variable assignment we are assigning the variable `four` to the string "four"
# 2.5
print something = "nothing"
# => "nothing" => nil
# the return of nil is on the same line because of the use of `print`
